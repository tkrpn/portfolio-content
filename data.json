This ensemble of models for the technical analysis of price trends and the sentiment classifier of the headlines was intended to become the basis for automated trading. \nThe screenshots show the backtesting tool created in Python and PyQt for this purpose (including portfolio and stock simulation and plotting).

ERP systems in particular, which represent the dominant class of enterprise systems, are struggling to meet the new requirements at all levels of the architecture. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reconsider the overall architecture of the systems and address the root of the related issues. Given that many restrictions ERP pose on their adaptability are related to the standardization of data, the database layer of ERP systems is addressed. Since database serve as the foundation for data storage and retrieval, they limit the flexibility of enterprise systems and the chance to adapt to new requirements accordingly. So far, relational databases are widely used. Using a systematic literature approach, recent requirements for ERP systems were identified. Prominent database approaches were assessed against the 23 requirements identified. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of recent database approaches. To this end, the results highlight the demand to combine multiple database approaches to fulfill recent business requirements. From a conceptual point of view, this paper supports the idea of federated databases which are interoperable to fulfill future requirements and support business operation. This research forms the basis for renewal of the current generation of ERP systems and proposes to ERP vendors to use different database concepts in the future."},

As digital transformation continues apace, companies are facing new challenges that lead to a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. To face these challenges, vision, understanding, clarity and agility allow to anticipative and implement necessary changes. This, of course, has implications for the role of the enterprise architect. S/he needs to start actively supporting innovation and taking more of an advisory role instead of just being driven by the current state of the enterprise architecture.

Survey results include the evaluation of statements on current tasks of enterprise architects, their influence on projects and companies as well as future requirements on the roles of the enterprise architect.

Therefore, enormous costs are called for these and consumed for the operation. This presentation dealt with how a correct selection of a suitable ERP system must be carried out in order to maximize the selection security, i.e. to find a system that exactly fits one's own requirements. for this purpose, an overview of the market was also given and it was explained which pitfalls are to be considered during the selection."},

In the first step, a process map was created on the basis of which the most important core processes were represented and linked with each other.

In order to simplify this process in the future and to be able to use additional data sources (alongside business data, production data in particular), a concept was developed for organizing data in cloud-based data lakes, data warehouses and data marts and making it available for analysis. This included the collection of requirements and their translation into technical and organizational concepts, including the pre-selection of suitable system components as well as catalogs of measures and roadmaps for the next steps."},
